# go(ing)myway?

As I was listinging to this [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way_(Frank_Sinatra_album)) I thought I might share a bit of how I enjoy writing a Go web app with a database connection. 

My Way:

 * clean and effective way to express ideas into code. 
 * fast feedback loop to keep me from doing stupid things (static typing, interfaces, database transactions ect)
 * simple: shallow stacks, low cognative load, transparent not clever
 * good sense of humility and humor about the set of compromises that have been choosen
